# resume-jekyll

A personal interactive resume.

Built using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).

Uses a Jekyll resume template designed by [byanko55](https://github.com/byanko55/jekyll-professional-resume/tree/master).

This is my first time using Jekyll. It's my attempt to figure it out and get into the game.
